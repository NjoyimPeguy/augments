# Test-Driven Development — Mocking

Most worthless tests come from mocking the wrong thing. The rules:

## Substitute only at a real boundary

Use a fake, stub, or mock where the test's scope meets a justified seam:
external services, database, clock, randomness, network, filesystem, or an owned
component whose contract is independently verified. Run ordinary owned logic
inside that scope for real.

**Never substitute the unit under test or its private helpers.** If every owned
collaborator is mocked, the test proves a call script rather than behavior.
Inject a genuine boundary dependency so the test can supply a small stand-in,
and cover an owned substituted boundary with a separate contract or integration
gate. Ownership alone neither justifies nor forbids the seam.

## Test the behavior, not the mock

A test that asserts "the mock was called" proves only that you set up a mock. Assert the observable result your caller would see. If removing the real component still makes the test pass, you are testing the mock.

## Keep mocks honest

- **Mirror the real shape.** A stub returning only the fields you currently read breaks silently when the code later needs a field you omitted. Match the real response.
- **Don't mock away the behavior under test.** If the test depends on a side effect, mocking the method that produces it guts the test.
- **One seam, one shape.** Structure external calls as specific functions (one per operation), so each test injects one simple stand-in instead of a branching mock factory.

## Keep production code clean

Cleanup or inspection helpers that exist only for tests belong in test utilities, never on the production type.
